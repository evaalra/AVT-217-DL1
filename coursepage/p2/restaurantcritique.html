	<h1>Restaurant Critique for Project 2</h1>
	<p> After observing various restuarant websites, I have compiled a list of the five best designed restuarants in the Metro Area.</p>
	
	<h2>Nandos<br><br>
	<a href="https://www.nandos.com/"> <img src="Nandos.PNG" alt="Nandos Desktop Screen"></a></h2>
		<p> Nandos' website has a bright and interactive interface that allows for the user to gain a better understanding of the brand's core values and what the food might taste like. The website is easy to navigate and understand. Each tab has its own color scheme consistent with the branding - they also make the information pop. The grid is consistent throughout. </p>

	<h2>Founding Farmers<br><br>
	<a href="https://www.wearefoundingfarmers.com/"> <img src="foundingfarmers.PNG" alt="Founding Farmers Desktop Screen"></a></h2>
		
		<p> This website shows the user what makes their food unique by giving them a brief summary of their current deals and popular menu items. Since Founding Farmers' core values include the arts and farming - they ensued that their website displayed exactly this. The interface is simple it starts the user with a slideshow of various pictures of food and their tables. The site also allows the user to experience a digital gallery tour of the artworks they commission from local artists.</p>

		<h2>Falafel Inc<br><br>
	<a href="https://www.falafelinc.org/"> <img src="falafelinc.PNG" alt="Falafel Inc Desktop Screen"></a></h2>
		
		<p> Falafel Inc's website is very intuitive and interactive. The branding of the restuarant is very bold, modern, and minimal and they were sure to display that through their design. Falafel Inc followed the same grid throughout and has an aesthetically pleasing interface. They also supplemented their design and content by adding subtle animations to give the photos a pop. I think this is successful because it makes me, the user, want to try their food.</p>

	<h2>Shake Shack<br><br>
	<a href="https://www.shakeshack.com/"> <img src="shakeshack.PNG" alt="Shake Shack Desktop Screen"></a></h2>
		
		<p> Shake Shack has a very nice and bright home screen that automatically draws the viewers eyes into the various food options. Some of the first information that the reader sees is the originating story of the restaurant. It then promotes their milkshake options and variaties. The page is more geared for how the viewer can help their community - which is a strong focus. The interface is minimal and clean, has consistent use of grids and color palette and is easy to navigate.</p>
