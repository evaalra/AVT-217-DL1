<h1> Creative Brief</h1>
<p> Portfolios are a necessary addition for all designers in this modern world. Most, if not all, jobs require a digital website portfolio to be submitted when applying to work. This means that portfolio websites should be well designed and considered as an extension to one’s work. </p>
	
<p>As a senior graphic designer, I have been able to develop my own branding and logo. For this portfolio, I will incorporate this branding I developed throughout the website. My style is minimal and simple, and the portfolio should reflect that. </p> 
	
<p> Through my research, I found that the best way to catch a client’s attention is by making the website unique to oneself. Combining personal and professional elements to add a personal touch. Adding to this, I learned that simplicity is not just through visual design, but also in terms of user experience. Clients primarily want to understand who I am, what I do, and what I did. </p>
	
<p> My navigation bar will consist of a home introduction, portfolio/work, resume, and contact. I want my website to be straightforward and easy to use. Each portfolio piece will have explanations behind the process and challenges, a list of programs used, who the client is, and the year it was made. </p>
