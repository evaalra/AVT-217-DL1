	<h1>Portfolio Critique for Project 3</h1>
	<p> After observing various designer websites, I have compiled a list of the five best designed portfolio websites.</p>
	
	<h2>Heather Shaw<br><br>
	<a href="http://heathershaw.com/"> <img src="heathershaw.PNG" alt="Heather Shaw Portfolio"></a></h2>
		<p> Heather Shaw created a very visually compelling website. It first opens up with a blue toned selfie of herself as the background. I liked this approach as it gave the user an idea of who the designer is, as well as added a personal touch.<br> </p>
			
		<p> She has a distinct brand with specific color palettes incorporated throughout. This reinforces her design skills and makes her website that much more professional. Each portfolio piece has a hover that allows the user to view the project title and type. <br> </p>
			
		<p>At the very bottom of the page, she invites the user to contact her for work. It also has a link to her social media accounts, and her about me page. I found it interesting that the about me was at the bottom rather than top of the page. Perhaps, the purpose of this is to allow the user to focus more on her work before learning about who she is. </p>

	<h2>Chris Tammar<br><br>
	<a href="https://www.christammar.com/"> <img src="christammar.PNG" alt="Chris Tammar Portfolio"></a></h2>
		
		<p> Chris Tammar went for a more minimal approach. I found it to be very successful because his logo is minimal as well – so there is a balanced relationship between his portfolio and branding. </p>
	
		<p> Chris used large boxes to showcase his work, only allowing for two pieces of work to show per row. Because of this, the user can see what the projects consist of (project type, style, business, etc). This allows for potential clients or hiring recruiters to take a glance and quickly understand his style. </p>
			
		<p> Chris only has two navigational options: projects, and contacts. While he does not make a case for why he should be hired when first entering his website – his work still speaks for itself. The strong and consistent designs, and his showcase of that, allow for users to be intrigued and impressed. </p>
			
		<p> His contact page has a headshot photograph of him, a link to download his resume, a form, and a brief biography of what he does. </p>

		<h2>Chip Kidd<br><br>
	<a href="http://chipkidd.com/home/portfolio-3/"> <img src="chipkidd.PNG" alt="Chip Kidd Portfolio"></a></h2>
		
		<p> While not traditional, Chip Kidd’s design style is very eyecatching (which is the point, right?). His website has a monochromatic theme, with a Peanuts comic strip image on the left, and a biological image of sorts to the left. This seems to communicate his personality/interests to the user. It gives the opportunity for a more personal touch and a less intimidating approach. It can even serve as a conversation starter between himself and the client.</p>
			
		<p> Chip has a menu bar on the leftside of the page, and it works very well with navigation. It includes a home, journal, portfolio, next-appearance, press kit, and contact. Interestingly enough, the menu bar is also expandable. The user has the option to hide it, and drag it back down. </p>

		<p> He specializes in bookcover design, and makes it easy to view his work all at once. With this profession – there is no need to redirect the viewer to another page to look at a cover. Instead, Chipp transformed his site into a gallery styled view. The user can just click the cover that appeals most to them and take a look.</p>

	<h2>Kate Moross<br><br>
	<a href="https://www.katemoross.com/"> <img src="katemoross.PNG" alt="Kate Moross Portfolio"></a></h2>
		
		<p> Kate Moross has a very vibrant and colorful portfolio that reflects the work she creates. It consists of dozens of photos layered above one another, with a handwritten comment about her industry. I first assumed that the photos were only for appearance. Turns out they are actually links that redirect the user to more detailed info about the piece. </p>
		
		<p> Her front page has a compilation of all her work. The menu bar allows the user to locate more specific types of work: editorial, hand drawn type, geometric, etc. Every page on her site displays a colorful and unique touch of her artistic style. Kate is sure to maintain her branding throughout her portfolio and this allows her work to stand out greatly!</p>
	
		<p>Overall, this portfolio is very well done and inspires me to get creative in my portfolio design. </p>

	<h2>Lauren Hom<br><br>
	<a href="https://www.homsweethom.com/"> <img src="laurenhom.PNG" alt="Lauren Hom Portfolio"></a></h2>
		
		<p> Lauren Hom is hand lettering artist. Her portfolio website is very successful in reflecting her talent as she has found a way to incorporate It all throughout the webpage. The logo is hand lettered and very visually appealing. The color palette allows the users eyes to move down the screen and better understand her goals. </p>
		
		<p> The homepage walks the user through her products, classes, and services. It allows the user to register for weekly lettering tutorials and take online classes to improve their lettering. Lauren incorporates hand drawn icons to bring more attention to her services. These icons also work very well with her overall branding – allowing for a more cohesive website. </p>
		
		<p> Laurens work is displayed in a tile format. She also includes GIFs of some of her work, making them more eyecatching and visually appealing. When looking at single pieces of work, she is sure to include information on who the client is, the agency, and the project itself.</p>
		
		<p> Overall, Laurens portfolio sells her work to her clients and fanbase very well. She gives the opportunity for the user to learn more about who she is and what she does, as well as leaves glimpses of her work style throughout – before pushing the viewer to look at her work portfolio. </p>
